# Stock_Market_Analysis

**Overview**

Stock analysis is a tool for buyers and traders to make decisions on buying and selling. By analyzing and reviewing past and current data, investors and traders are trying to gain market advantage by taking informed decisions.

**Goals**

--> What was the change in the price of the stock over time?

--> What was the daily return of the stock on average?

--> What was the moving average of the various stocks?

--> What was the correlation between different stocks' closing prices?

--> What was the correlation between different stocks' daily returns?

--> How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?

--> How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?

**Method**

--> Looking at data from the stock market, in particular some of the stock of technology.

--> Pandas to get information about the stock, visualize the various aspects of it.

--> Eventually, we're going to look at a few ways to quantify the risk of a stock.

--> Forecasting future stock prices using the Monte Carlo process.

**Conclusion**

Using the Analysis only for google, we get a 1 percent empiric quantile of the final price distribution to estimate the value at risk for Google stock, which is estimated to be $62.27 for each investment of 1235.99, which is the price of one Google stock.
Essentially, for every initial stock you purchase, you put at risk around $62.27 which is  99 percent of the time from our Monte Carlo Simulation.
